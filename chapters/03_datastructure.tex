\section{Skiplist is suitable for range lock}
The effectiveness of a range lock is strongly influenced by the underlying data structure used to manage these ranges. 
Existing range locks use many different comparison-based data structures, such as interval tree~\parencite{linuxRangeLockImpl2013, kim2019pnova} and linked list~\parencite{song2013parallelizing}, skip list~\parencite{kogan2020scalable}, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. 

Interval trees are considered heavyweight compared to linked lists and skip lists because they require complex balancing mechanisms to maintain efficient search times, which adds significant computational and memory overhead. 
Interval trees also require the maintenance of additional data, such as subtree intervals, making them more resource-intensive. This makes interval trees unsuitable for range locking. 

Linked lists have minimal structure and are easy to implement and maintain. However, they have a high cost in terms of Insert/Delete time. The O(n) complexity for the average search case becomes a significant disadvantage when the number of ranges increases, 

Skiplists strike a balance between the heaviness of interval trees and the simplicity of linked lists. Despite their theoretically poor worst-case performance, skip lists seldom exhibit such behavior, making them efficient in most scenarios.
For example, in a dictionary with more than 250 entries, the probability that a search will take more than three times the expected time is less than one in a million~\parencite{pugh1990skip2}. 

We strongly believe that the skip list is ideal for implementing range locking.

\section{Modification of skiplist for concurrent range lock}

Although the high-level idea of skiplist meets the requirement for range locking, conventional skiplists does not work out of the box for range locking yet. 
Firstly, it should be noted that each node of the skiplist stores a key and a value, rather than a range. 
Secondly, the comparison conditions must be modified, as it is no longer sufficient to simply use the key; instead, both the range start and range end must be taken into account when inserting or deleting. 
These two aspects -- node storage and comparison conditions -- require modification.

We therefore propose a new data structure on the basis of the original skip list.
We developed our structure based on the \texttt{LockFreeSkipList} proposed by Herlihy et al.~\parencite{herlihy2020art}. 
The two critical modifications of node storage and comparison conditions are presented in the Sections \ref{subsec:node} and \ref{subsec:find}, respectively.

In summary, \texttt{LockFreeSkipList} uses atomic operations (\texttt{compareAndSwap()}) to manage node references without locks, thereby enhancing performance in multithreaded environments.
When a node is added, the process begins at the lowest level and progresses upward, ensuring immediate visibility. 
Node removal involves marking nodes from the top down before unlinking them. 
Additionally, it relaxes the strict structural maintenance of higher levels, focusing on the bottom-level list for set representation, which offers improved scalability and efficiency.

\subsection{Node}\label{subsec:node}

\texttt{Node} is the base of our \texttt{ConcurrentRangeLock} structure.
Each \texttt{Node} instance now contains \textbf{\texttt{start}} and \textbf{\texttt{end}}, which represent one range.
\texttt{Node} uses an array of \textbf{\texttt{AtomicMarkableReference}} (more details in Section \ref{subsec:atomicmarkablereference}) to maintain forward links at each level, which allows for efficient traversal and updates. 
\texttt{Node} provides the following methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{initialize}: sets up a node with specific range and level values.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{initializeHead}}: configures the head node with forward pointers directed to a provided tail node, establishing the initial structure.
    \item \texttt{getTopLevel()}, \texttt{getStart()}, \texttt{getEnd()}: accessor methods to retrieve the properties of node.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AtomicMarkableReference} \label{subsec:atomicmarkablereference}

We want to keep the high levels of range locking non-blocking. 
We employed a common technique in concurrent linked list implementations of marking the node~\parencite{harris2001pragmatic}. 
In brief, the least significant bit (LSB) of the next pointer is set to mark the current node as deleted. 
This enables the soft deletion of a node, which can then be physically deleted at a later stage by any other process without blocking the others. 
Therefore, we track successors of a \texttt{Node} by an array of \texttt{AtomicMarkableReference}.

An \texttt{AtomicMarkableReference} object encapsulates both a reference to an object of type T and a boolean mark, which can be atomically updated, either together or individually. 
It uses a single atomic variable, \texttt{atomicRefMark}, to store a packed representation of both the reference and a mark. 
If the mark is \texttt{1}, it indicates that the predecessor of this node has been softly deleted. 
These values are packed and unpacked using bitwise operations, where the least significant bit represents the mark.

Listing \ref{lst:atomicmarkablereference} provides the algorithm for \texttt{AtomicMarkableReference}.

The \texttt{pack} method combines a node pointer and a boolean mark into a single \texttt{uintptr\_t} value by encoding the pointer into the lower bits and the mark into the highest bit. Conversely, the \texttt{unpack} method decodes this packed value to retrieve the original node pointer and boolean mark.

To atomically set a new node pointer and mark value, the \texttt{store} method uses relaxed memory ordering.

The \texttt{compareAndSwap} method performs an atomic update of both the reference and mark if they match the expected values, employing acquire-release memory ordering for proper synchronization.

The \texttt{attemptMark} method focuses on updating only the mark, provided that the current reference matches the expected one and the mark is different. If the update succeeds, it returns \texttt{true}; otherwise, it returns \texttt{false}.

The \texttt{get} method retrieves the current reference and mark, which stores the mark in the provided boolean pointer. In contrast, the \texttt{getReference} method returns the current reference without accessing the mark.
