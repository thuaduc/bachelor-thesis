\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chapter:evaluation}

The proposed approach will be evaluated under these evaluation criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance:} We will test the range lock mechanism under increasing load and concurrent accesses to measure its performance.
    \item \textbf{Correctness:} We will ensure the consistency and correctness of data accesses, especially when there are overlapping data ranges and concurrent operations.
    \item \textbf{Comparison:} We will compare the performance of the proposed solution with existing state-of-the-art approaches.
\end{itemize}
