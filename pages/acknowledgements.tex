I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my dedicated supervisor Prof. Dr. Viktor Leis and advisor Lam-Duy Nguyen, for their unwavering support and guidance. They have consistently provided support and motivation, even amid their busy schedule.

My heartfelt appreciation to my girlfriend, Thuy-Trang Nguyen, for standing by me through the challenges of my thesis and undergraduate journey. She has consistently provided support and motivation.

Eventually, I would like to send a special acknowledgment to my family and friends whose encouragement has been a source of strength and an integral part during the course of my studies.

I would not have been able to accomplish this work without the support of each of these people.
