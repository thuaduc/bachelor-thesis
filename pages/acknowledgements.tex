I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Viktor Leis, and my advisor, Lam-Duy Nguyen, for their constant support, guidance, and encouragement. Even with their busy schedules, they always made time to help me, and I am very grateful for that.

I am also deeply thankful to my girlfriend, Thuy-Trang Nguyen, for being by my side throughout the challenges of this thesis and my studies. Her support and encouragement have meant the world to me.

I also want to express my heartfelt thanks to my family and friends, whose encouragement has given me strength during my studies.

This accomplishment would not have been possible without the support of all these incredible individuals.
